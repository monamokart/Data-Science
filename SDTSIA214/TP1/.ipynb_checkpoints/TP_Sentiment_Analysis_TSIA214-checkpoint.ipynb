    "# Dense Representations \n",
    "\n",
    "##  Word Embeddings : Distributed representations via the distributional hypothesis \n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal**: We will try to obtain dense representations (as vectors of real numbers) of words (and possibly sentences). These representations are intended to be distributed: they are non-local representations. We represent an object as a combination of *features*, as opposed to the attribution of a dedicated symbol: see the founding work of Geoffrey Hinton, among others, on the subject: [Distributed Representations](https://web.stanford.edu/~jlmcc/papers/PDP/Chapter3.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "The term *distributed* representations is very general, but is what we are looking for. The challenge is therefore to be able to build, automatically, such representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Underlying idea**: It is based on the distributional hypothesis: contextual information is sufficient to obtain a viable representation of linguistic objects.\n",
    " - For a large class of cases [...] the meaning of a word is its use in the language.\" Wittgenstein (Philosophical Investigations, 43 - 1953)\n",
    " - You shall know a word by the company it keeps, Firth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, a word can be characterized by the words that accompany it, via co-occurrence counts. Two words with a similar meaning will have a similar contextual distribution and are therefore more likely to appear in similar contexts. This hypothesis can be used as a justification for the application of statistics to semantics (information extraction, semantic analysis). It also allows some form of generalization: we can assume that the information we have about a word will be generalized to words with a similar distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Motivation**: The goal is to obtain distributed representations in order to be able to effectively**:\n",
    "- Directly perform a semantic surface analysis.\n",
    "- Use it as a source of information for other language-related models and applications, especially for sentiment analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Terminology**: Be careful not to confuse the idea of *distributed* and *distributional* representation. The latter generally indicates (for words) that the representation has been obtained strictly from co-occurrence counts, whereas additional information (document labels, part of speech tags, ...) can be used to build distributed representations. \n",
    "The models that allow to build these dense representations, in the form of vectors, are often called *vector spaces models*. These representations are also regularly called *word embeddings*, because the words are embedded in a vector space. In French, we often find the term *word embedding* or *lexical embedding*."

    "## Getting representations: counts of occurrences and co-occurrences\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the type of corpus available, different types of distributional information can be obtained. If we have access to a collection of documents, we can thus choose to count the number of occurrences of each word in each document, to obtain a $words \\times documents$ matrix: it is on this principle that **Tf-Idf** is built. We will now look at a more general case: we have a large amount of data in text form, and we want to obtain representations of words in the form of vectors of reduced size, without the need to divide them into documents or categories. \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have a corpus containing $T$ different words. We will construct a $\\mathbf{M}$ matrix of size $T \\times T$ which will contain the number of co-occurrences between words. There will be different factors to consider when constructing this matrix: \n",

    "- How do we quantify the importance of the counts? \n",
    "\n",

    "- Should we keep all the words that appear in the corpus? \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\rightarrow$ Usually not. We will see that for large corpora, the number $T$ of different words is huge. Second, even if the number of words is reasonable, we will have very little distributional information on the rarest words, and the representation obtained will be of poor quality. We will have to ask ourselves how to filter these words, and how to treat the words we choose not to represent.  "

    "\n",
    "#### Dimension reduction via SVD \n",
    "\n",
    "A matrix is a linear transformation: applying an SVD to it means decomposing our linear transformation into a product of linear transformations of different types. In fact, we will change the basis of our vector, and replace our data in a space where each of the coordinates are unchanged by the transformation carried out. Thus, we decompose the matrix $\\mathbf{M}$ into three matrices:\n",

    "- $\\mathbf{\\lambda}$ is a diagonal matrix: careful, it's not necessarily square. Values on the diagonal are the eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{M}$.\n",

    "Note: When we apply this method to the matrix of $\\mathbf{M}$ counts of dimension $T \\times D$, where $\\mathbf{M}_{t,d}$ contains the number of occurrences of the word $t$ in the document $d$, we obtain the method called **Latent Semantic Analysis**, for the detection of latent (semantic) components allowing the grouping of documents.

So we'll get the vocabulary (in full) and represent the frequencies of the words, in order (be careful, you'll have to use a logarithmic scale): we should find back Zipf's law. This will give us an idea of the size of the vocabulary we will be able to choose: it's a matter of making a compromise between the necessary resources (size of the objects in memory) and the amount of information we can get from them (rare words can bring a lot of information, but it's difficult to learn good representations of them, because they are rare!).

    "### Word2Vec\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "####  The skip-gram model\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic skip-gram model tries to predict the context words $c$ surrounding a given center word $w$. Hence, it needs to estimate the probabilities of a pair of words $(i, j)$ to appear together in data:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(j \\mid i) = \\frac{\\exp(w_{i} c_{j})}{\\sum_{j'\\in V}\\exp(w_{i} c_{j'})}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "where $w_{i}$ is the lign vector (of the word) $i$ representing the center word and $c_{j}$ is the column vector (of one of the context words) $j$. The objective is to minimize the following quantity:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ -\\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{D}} \\sum_{j \\in \\mathcal{N}_i} \\sum_{k=1}^{|V|} \\textbf{1}\\{o_{i}=k\\} \\log \\frac{\\exp(w_{i} c_{k})}{\\sum_{j=1}^{|V|} \\exp(w_{i} c_{j})}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "where $V$ is the vocabulary. Here, the first sum goes accross words $i$ the dataset $\\mathcal{D}$; the second accross context words $j$ in the neighborhood $\\mathcal{N}_i$ of word $i$; and the third sums probabilities the context word $j$ being the $k$-th word in the vocabulary for each $k \\in V$.\n",
    "The inputs $w_{i}$ are the representations of the center words, while $c_j$ are representations of the context words; both are made up of parameters, which are updated during training. Note that in this case, those representations are different, and we only keep the $w$ as final word representations to be used in NLP tasks - but it is possible to use the same parameters for $w$ and $c$, or to keep the mean of both representations at the end.  \n",
    "The **desired output** of the model is an *one-hot* $o$ vector, which contains only one $1$ and $0$. For example, if `good` is the 47th word in the vocabulary, the output $o$ for an example when `good` is the word to predict will consist of $0$s everywhere except $1$ in the 47th position of the vector. `good` will be the word to predict when the input $w$ is a word in its context.\n",
    "We therefore model this output with standard **softmax**, which will represent a probability distribution over $V$; and we add a bias term $b$. To obtain the vector of output probabilities, we need to vectorialize over all possible context words in $V$ - which means using the full matrix $C$ containing all vectors $c$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ o = \\textbf{softmax}(wC + b)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we train the parameters contained in $W$ and $C$, two matrices representing the words in reduced dimension (300) using a maximum likelihood objective.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Skip-gram with negative sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "The training of the skip-gram model implies to calculate a sum on the whole vocabulary, because of the *softmax*. As soon as the size of the vocabulary increases, it becomes impossible to compute. In order to make the calculations faster, we change the objective and use the method of *negative sampling* (or, very close to it, the *noise contrastive estimation*).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If here we note $\\mathcal{N'}_i$ a set of words that are **not** in the context of the word $i$, the objective is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{D}} \\sum_{j \\in \\mathcal{N}_i} -\\log\\sigma(w_{i}c_{j}) + \\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{D}} \\sum_{j \\in \\mathcal{N'}_i}\\log\\sigma(w_{i}c_{j})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\sigma$ is the sigmoid activation function $\\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-x)}$.\n",
    "In practice, we draw randomly these *negative* words that are not in the context, and we don't differentiate depending on the input word $i$: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{D}} \\sum_{j \\in \\mathcal{N}_i} -\\log\\sigma(w_{i}c_{j}) + \\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{D}} \\sum_{j \\in \\mathcal{N'}}\\log\\sigma(w_{i}c_{j})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "A common practice is to generate pairs from $\\mathcal{N}'$ in proportion to the frequencies of the words in the training data (the so-called unigram distribution):\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(w) = \\frac{\\textbf{T}(w)^{0.75}}{\\sum_{w'\\in V} \\textbf{T}(w')}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Although different, this new objective function is a sufficient approximation of the previous one, and is based on the same principle. Much research has been done on this objective: for example, [Levy and Golberg 2014](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5477-neural-word-embedding-as-implicit-matrix-factorization) shows that the objective calculates the PMI matrix shifted by a constant value. One can also see [Cotterell et al. 2017](https://aclanthology.coli.uni-saarland.de/papers/E17-2028/e17-2028) for an interpretation of the algorithm as a variant of PCA."
